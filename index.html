         Eliminate disrespectful behaviors such as rolling your eyes, interrupting or talking negatively about someone. Not only are these actions not respectful of the person you’re interacting with, they deter or prevent further involvement or resolution of issues, and create a wedge that can become permanent. 
            <br/><br/>
      Instead, foster an environment of respectful listening. Everyone deserves to be heard, even if you don’t agree with a person’s views or opinions. Consider how you’d like to be treated if you have something to say, especially if there is an important issue at hand.

                <p class="origin-para-c">Listening is an active process, not a passive one. Think before you speak. Most often in today’s conversations, one person’s comments “trigger” thoughts in the listener, who then brings forth their own story along the same lines. Instead of telling your tale, ask questions that encourage the speaker to tell you more. Most people will be flattered that you care.

                <p class="origin-para-rs">People earn respect by always being ready to lend a hand or an ear whenever they’re needed or notice an opportunity to help. Look for opportunities to help that you might have previously overlooked. Does a co-worker need help with a big project? Can you grab a cup of coffee for someone? Strive to be helpful several times a day.</p>
                <p class="origin-para-ls">Your actions are based on your choices, and barring some unforeseen circumstance, there is no reason for excuses. Own your actions. For example, if you’re constantly late, don’t make lame excuses. Own up to your mistakes and instead of dwelling on them, look for opportunities to move past them and do better next time. Instead of focusing on your shortcomings, ask, “How can I rectify my behavior or situation?”</p>

It even happens in business and professional settings. For example, there is often disagreement amongst scientists about how and why things work. Inventors face many challenges to their new ideas. Sometimes their ideas are met with opposition. If they're handled respectfully, however, inventors might be able to move forward and use their failures to create even better products in the future. </div>

You'll need your thinking cap, because we want you to think hard about how you've acted over the last several days. First, think back over the last couple of days and make a list of things you've done or said that showed respect to others. Then, being honest with yourself, do the same with things you've done or said that were disrespectful

You can classify the reason behind your goals in two ways: intrinsic and extrinsic.

Can your friends or family members add any examples to either of your lists? You might be surprised by the things that others notice that you don't even remember! How can you learn to increase the number of ways you act respectfully? More importantly, what are some things you can do to change disrespectful behaviors?

                        .While respect should be second nature to us (Aretha made darn sure we knew how to spell it and practice it), there seems to be a major deficit of it in our world today. From mean tweets to cliquish behavior on the playground, respect is plainly overdue for a comeback. The good news is that you can play a big role in starting a respect revolution just by modeling respect yourself and teaching your girl to follow suit.. <br/><br/>
